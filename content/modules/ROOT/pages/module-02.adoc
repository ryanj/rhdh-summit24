= Chapter 2: The Software Catalog
Before you can do much work, you have to find your tools and materials. The Developer Portal’s Software Catalog, shown in Figure 2-1, provides a searchable index of APIs, services, and software components.

== Catalog overview
The catalog provides a central, organized location where development teams can register and document the services and components they use in their software projects. This includes information about applications, APIs, libraries, databases, and more.

Backstage, and Developer Hub in turn, is a switchboard for integration with other tools and services, such as version control systems, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring. Integration means the catalog reflects the current state of the real world, and you can comprehend that state without bouncing between different user interfaces for each integrated service.

Organizations can customize the Software Catalog and most of Developer Hub. This allows you to define what types of services or components should be included, how information is structured, and what access rules regulate who can see or modify components and sections of the portal.

=== What’s in the catalog?

The Software Catalog can contain a wide variety of items, broadly categorized into the following:

 * *Services:* backend services, microservices, or server-side applications.
 * *Websites:* frontend applications, web apps, or static websites.
 * *Libraries:* shared code libraries or modules that can be used by other software components.
 * *Documentation:* standalone documentation sites or repositories containing documentation related to software components.
 * *APIs:* RESTful APIs, GraphQL APIs, or any other API endpoints.
 * *Data pipelines:* ETL jobs, data processing pipelines, and other data-intensive workflows.
 * *Components:* any other software components that don't neatly fit into the above categories but are part of the organization's development and delivery landscape.

The Software Catalog is designed to improve software development and operational efficiency by providing a centralized, searchable, and documented catalog of all the software components in an organization. Its ability to integrate with various tools and provide insights into the health and status of components is what makes it so valuable.

== Catalog Purpose and Usage

The primary purpose of defining entities in the Software Catalog is to provide a structured and searchable inventory of all software components within an organization. This inventory aids in visibility, governance, and operational efficiency by creating a comprehensive, integrated view of an organization's software landscape, streamlining workflows, and enhancing the developer experience.

=== Day-to-day development

*Registering software components:* developers register components either manually through the UI or automatically via discovery mechanisms set up by the team.

*Discovery and browsing:* once components are registered, you can use the catalog to discover existing components, APIs, and tools which aids in reusing code, understanding dependencies, and learning about other teams' projects.

*Understanding components:* for each component, the catalog provides detailed information, including its ownership, life cycle status (e.g., production, deprecated), documentation, the component's repository,  and operational dashboards.

*Integrating and using APIs:* when building or updating services, you can use the catalog to find and integrate APIs, and have access to endpoints, documentation, and even testing tools all of which simplifies the integration process.

=== Collaboration and governance

*Ownership and responsibilities:* the catalog clearly defines the ownership of each component, making it easier to identify and contact the responsible teams for collaboration, support, or contributions.

*Compliance and best practices:* teams can enforce standards, best practices, and compliance requirements through the catalog by means of software templates.

=== Maintenance and improvement

*Monitoring and health checks:* Developer Hub and the Software Catalog integrate with monitoring and CI/CD tools, allowing developers to see the health, performance, and build status of their components directly within the catalog. This centralized overview aids in proactive maintenance and troubleshooting.

*Documentation and resources:* developers can access and contribute to the documentation of components, improving knowledge sharing and collaboration. The Software Catalog often serves as a gateway to a component's documentation, decision records, and related resources.

=== Scalability and evolution

As the organization grows, the catalog supports the *scaling of software development processes* by streamlining component registration, discovery, and management. It helps maintain a clear overview of the software landscape, even as the number of components increases.
