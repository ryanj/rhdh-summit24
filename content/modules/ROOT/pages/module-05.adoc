= Bonus Chapter 5: Application Maintenance

You’ve learned how to jump-start a new application with Software Templates, which scaffolded source repos for you and eventually constructed container images and deployed them on Kubernetes. But, software is never finished. Sooner or later, you’ll need to update your templates and the components they generate. In this chapter, you’ll see how to manage selected maintenance and upgrade tasks in Red Hat Developer Hub.

== Updating existing components

It’s crucial not to forget about the fact that despite introducing changes to a specific software template and thereby create a new version of the template, existing applications built from the original template do not adhere to any newly defined standards. So how should you go about that? 

Unsurprisingly, the answer again is related to yet another template that will make the procedure of patching previously created software components a lot easier and less error prone. By making sure that the necessary changes are first suggested to existing source code repositories by means of a pull request, component owners can review everything and have a final say before eventually merging the auto-generated changes originating from the applied "patch template."

=== Apply the predefined patch template

Go to *+ Create* and select the *Quarkus Application Patch Template* by clicking the *CHOOSE* button in the lower-right corner of the template tile (Figure 5-7).

==== Template form wizard

This brings you to the link:{rhdh_url}/create/templates/default/quarkus-app-patch[template’s form wizard] where you can configure certain elements of the template. In the first section of this form (Figure 5-8), you provide information about the component that you want to apply this patch on. In this example, it’s the GitLab group/owner (default: `development`), and most importantly, the GitLab repo name(s) that should get patched. You are going to specify the repo name by clicking on the *+ ADD ITEM* button and entering the repo name of the frontend application, which is `{namespace}-poi-map` if you followed the naming conventions so far. You can optionally enter a particular name (default: `templated-app-patch`) for the repo branch that will store the code changes that should get applied by the template. This branch in turn becomes the source for the merge request that gets automatically opened.

In the second section (Figure 5-9), you can specify all information about the patch itself that is getting applied to the selected source code repositories. The template already provides the necessary defaults. In this example: 

 * the `pom.xml` file will get patched with the desired Quarkus version, and
 * the `Dockerfile` to build the container image will get patched with the proper base image.

Remember that another requirement was to include the `smallrye-health` extension. This is an additional change to the `pom.xml` file and happens without the need for explicit template configuration parameters.

Clicking the *NEXT STEP* button shows you a summary of all the entered form fields for a final review, as shown in Figure 5-10.

Click *CREATE* to kick-off the process of patching the component’s source code repository.

==== Template patching procedure

The Quarkus Application Patch Template (Figure 5-11) is composed of four sequential steps, each of which represents either a built-in or a custom scaffolder action available in your running RHDH portal:

. `fetch:plain`: This action fetches one or more source code repositories from its location and stores the repository contents into a working directory.
. `roadiehq:utils:fs:replace`: This action will look into each of the working directories and process the specified files as follows: 
.. `pom.xml`: Replace the Quarkus version and add the `smallrye-health` extension.
..  `Dockerfile`: Replace the base image.
. `publish:gitlab:merge-request`: After applying the necessary changes to selected files in the working directory, this action will create a merge request in the respective GitLab repository.
. `debug:log`: This action prints the full URL pointing to the merge request(s) that have been opened in one or more repositories.

=== Review the opened merge request

In GitLab, link:{gitlab_url}/development/{namespace}-poi-map/-/merge_requests[go to the repository] that has been patched by means of the template and inspect the opened merge request (Figure 5-12). The *Changes* tab shows the applied patches to the files as previously discussed.

=== Merge the auto-generated code changes

If everything went well and the review of the suggested code changes is positive, you as the component owner can merge this into the main branch. Go back to the *Overview* tab of the GitLab merge request, select the *Delete source branch* checkbox, and hit the *MERGE* button (Figure 5-13).

=== Inspect the build pipeline

Now that the code changes are merged into the main branch, a link:{rhdh_url}/catalog/default/component/{namespace}-poi-map-service/ci[new pipeline] run is triggered via a webhook. After about two to three minutes, your code changes are available in the freshly built container image for the POI map service (Figure 5-14).

=== Verify all updates for the component

Let’s verify if all the expected changes that have been applied by the patch template are indeed present. You can open the build pipeline details and then click on the second step named *package* to inspect the logs, as shown in Figure 5-15.

You can immediately see that the Quarkus version pulled down by Maven is now `3.6.7` instead of version `3.4.2` that was in use initially for this component according to the old template.

Next, click the *build-and-push* step in order to check for the container base image that should now be `ubi8/openjdk-17:1.18` rather than `ubi8/openjdk-17:1.16` (Figure 5-17).

Finally, open the link:{rhdh_url}/catalog/default/component/{namespace}-poi-map-service/topology[*Topology* tab] for the `{namespace}-poi-map-service` component. Click on the deployment and choose the *Resources* tab in the side pane that appears from the right to click *View Logs* (Figure 5-18).

If you scroll a bit further to the right within the logs window, you’ll now also find the `smallrye-health` extension additionally included next to all the others that have already been there before applying the patch template (Figure 5-19).
