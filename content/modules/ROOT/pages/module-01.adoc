= Chapter 1: A platform for portals

== The proliferating complexity of simple applications

Think about writing “Hello, World.” A few years ago, you’d grab your favorite editor or IDE, write some code, build it with your compiler or run it through your runtime. Then you’d hand it off to whoever controlled production when you pushed your locally-tested changes to the development branch.

Writing “Hello, World” hasn’t gotten any harder. But running it has. Hello World today means a running container, built by an automated pipeline (triggered by a source code commit) into a container image, stored in some registry, with an attendant manifest declaring how it should be brought to life by a container orchestrator. There is a lot of stuff that is not your application.

== Internal Developer Platforms

Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) aim to provide abstraction of development processes, offering a surface for capturing effective tools, libraries, source boilerplate, and configuration and centralizing access to them. Ironically, in the IDP ecosystem examined here, simplifying all that YAML involves… more YAML.

An Internal Developer Platform is a set of tools, services, and practices intended to improve the productivity and collaboration of software development teams by abstracting and automating the surrounding complexity of the development and deployment process. An IDP provides developers with a unified environment for managing application components, services, and the development lifecycle, including code, infrastructure, and deployment.

IDPs address several key challenges in the software development process, including:

* *Complexity:* Modern software development involves many tools, services, and processes. IDPs centralize access to these resources.
* *Collaboration:* IDPs promote collaboration by offering shared resources, standardized workflows, and a consistent experience in a development team.
* *Visibility:* Developers can’t always see what other teams are working on. IDPs make large deployment environments more transparent.
* *Productivity:* By automating repetitive tasks and providing self-service capabilities, IDPs allow developers to focus on writing code and delivering value.

=== Backstage: A platform for building developer portals

Backstage is an open source IDP platform created by Spotify, originally to serve their internal development. The Backstage software has three defining features.

* Software Catalog: A central repository for the services and components used in a team or organization, enabling discovery and reuse. Catalog entities index the disparate resources that go into an application, from source code to build services to orchestrated deployments.
* Standardized workflows: Designed to capture effective patterns, tools, processing used by development teams and present them as established paths to development, Backstage helps enforce best practices and standards.
* Plug-in ecosystem: Backstage supports custom plug-ins and a growing ecosystem of integration and automation plug-ins. Plug-ins integrate Backstage with infrastructure services and software components, import patterns and mechanisms, and allow teams to customize Backstage to integrate their own systems, tools, and methods. 
* Tech Docs conventionalize the mechanics of creating and publishing documentation but someone still has to write it. You can write documentation easily in Markdown or other familiar markups and manage it like code in your repos to see it compiled and published in an automated way.
* Search lets others find components, services, and documentation without clicking around endlessly.

Backstage's purpose is to enhance developer productivity with a single platform for development activities.

== Red Hat Developer Hub	 	 	 	

link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/developer-hub/overview[Red Hat Developer Hub] (RHDH) is an enterprise distribution with an open source project at its core. Harnessing the Backstage core code together with curated plug-ins, day-two configuration, and ready-made golden path templates for common development scenarios, RHDH in turn has an open source “midstream” project, called Janus, where community development efforts are organized and publicly conducted.

Like Backstage, Red Hat Developer Hub is a platform for building developer portals. There is always platform engineering work, with or without that formal title. Identifying patterns and standards and refining them in line with organization goals is a key part of getting value out of your site’s developer portal. RHDH makes it easier for you to get started with the examples in this lab by avoiding a lot of secondary decisions about integrations, configuration, and features that you’d need to make if you started from scratch with upstream Backstage.

== Note about names

You’ll see both the names Backstage and Red Hat Developer Hub in this lab, which uses RHDH as a convenient Backstage deployment. We don’t exactly use the terms interchangeably. Directions and examples will usually refer to Red Hat Developer Hub, but concepts and terms that come directly from the upstream Backstage core are named as such.
