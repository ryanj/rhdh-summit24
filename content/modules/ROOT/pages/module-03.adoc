= Chapter 3: Templates: Application Head Start

Software Templates are a Backstage feature for flexibly defining a starting point for some arbitrary kit. A template might represent a place to begin work on a new application built with some standard language or framework — for example, potentially including executables, runtimes or compilers of standard versions, boilerplate code, build configurations, and the like.

== The Point of Interest map application

The exercises in this book center on a world map application (Figure 3-1) that you can pan, zoom, and click to investigate arbitrary points of interest.

:!figure-caption:

image::3-1.png[title="Figure 3-{counter:figure}: The Point of Interest map application"]

You’ll construct the Point of Interest (POI) application with a set of templates that define and deploy foundation components, then use Red Hat Developer Hub’s Software Catalog, API index, and other facilities to implement the application and extend it with new features.

== Application specifics

Before we begin, let’s take a look at the application’s technologies and architecture.

=== Structure and technologies

The POI map application has four parts:

. A relational database that stores the point of interest records: *PostgreSQL*.
. A backend application exposing a REST API to serve the points of interest from the database, written in *TypeScript* with *NestJS*.
. A proxy application that sits as a facade between the backend and frontend to delegate web client requests to the backend’s REST API accordingly, written in *Java* with *Quarkus*.
. A Single Page Application (SPA) to provide the user interface where the map is displayed, written in *TypeScript* with *Angular*.

=== Architecture

While the backend, proxy, and frontend parts of the map application could be individually built and separately deployed, it makes sense to simplify the architecture a bit. The SPA frontend is embedded with the API client component, served with the Quarkus HTTP server methods. This gives the POI map application an architecture of three primary pieces: the frontend/API client machinery, the NestJS POI API backend, and the database. See Figure 3-2.

image::3-2.png[title="Figure 3-2: POI application architecture."]

== Software Templates

The scaffolding to support the three-part architecture of the map application is split between two templates, as shown in Figure 3-3. The first template deploys the backend application together with its database.The second template creates the framework for the frontend and API client.

image::3-3.png[title="Figure 3-3: Application architecture expressed in two templates."]

== Backend template
With this, you’re ready to start where most developers would: using a template to get the basics in place for building a new application.

Begin by creating an instance from the link:{rhdh_url}/create/templates/default/nestjs-with-postgres[`nestjs-with-postgres` template]. This template scaffolds the source repository for the backend service, builds the code in it, and deploys the result along with the database server on which the backend relies. Go to *+ Create* and select the template *NestJS Service with backing PostgreSQL database* by clicking the *CHOOSE* button in the lower-right corner of the template tile (Figure 3-10).

image::3-10.png[title="Figure 3-10: Portal Create view with template tiles."]

=== Template form wizard

This brings you to the template’s form wizard (Figure 3-11) where you can configure certain elements of the template. In the first section of this form, you define the GitLab location for the source code and GitOps repositories and you can add some description. It's fine to leave the defaults here.

image::3-11.png[title="Figure 3-11: NestJS Service template configuration form, first section."]

In the second section (Figure 3-12), you specify the who, what, and where of the application resources to be scaffolded from the template. The namespace _where_ (`demo{usernum}`) the running application should be deployed, _what_ (`poi-backend`) application ID names it, and the user _who_ (`user:user{usernum}`) owns it. You’ll see this metadata reflected in descriptions, data about, and links between entities in the Software Catalog after you submit the Create forms and scaffolding is complete.

image::3-12.png[title="Figure 3-12: NestJS Service template configuration form, second section."]

The third form section (Figure 3-13) specifies the container image registry where the application containers should be stored and available to the cluster orchestrator (OpenShift in the book’s exercises). You can also optionally set a tag for the container image. The default, `latest`, is acceptable for purposes of building the example application, although it is not usually a best practice for production.

image::3-13.png[title="Figure 3-13: NestJS Service template configuration form, third section."]

Clicking the *NEXT STEP* button shows you a summary of all the entered form fields for a final review, as shown in Figure 3-14. Click *CREATE* to kick off the process of scaffolding application resources from the template.

image::3-14.png[title="Figure 3-14: NestJS Service template configuration form, final review."]

=== Template scaffolding process

The NestJS Service backend template is composed of six sequential steps, each of which represents either a built-in or a custom scaffolder action available in your running RHDH portal:

image::3-15.png[title="Figure 3-15: NestJS Service template scaffolding."]

A lot has happened when you clicked *Create* and kicked off the process of scaffolding from a template. If you imagine yourself encountering a portal where this template is already available, the value of the developer portal comes into clearer focus. Think of bouncing between service UIs and auth systems to manually perform all the steps automated by the template actions, from source control in GitLab to GitOps processes to continually build from source with Argo CD and Tekton Pipelines. You can see a depiction of the services harnessed together by the template scaffolding process in Figure 3-18.


image::3-18.png[title="Figure 3-18: RHDH GitOps automation: Portal, GitLab, Argo CD, Tekton, OpenShift."]

=== Template results

Continuing with the itemization of the steps automated by RHDH in its process of scaffolding resources from the backend template, take a look at the GitOps resources the scaffolder puts in place:

. Two new repositories, link:{gitlab_url}/development/{namespace}-poi-backend[`{namespace}-poi-backend`] and link:{gitlab_url}/development/{namespace}-poi-backend-gitops[`{namespace}-poi-backend-gitops`], dividing application source from CI/CD automation resources (Figure 3-19).
+
image::3-19.png[title="Figure 3-19: GitLab repositories for the POI backend."]
+
. Three Argo CD "applications" (bootstrap, build pipeline, and actual application, as shown in Figure 3-20) for the build and deployment automation that form the basis of GitOps practices. These Argo applications are among the resources declared in the files beneath the link:{gitlab_url}/development/{namespace}-poi-backend-gitops[`{namespace}-poi-backend-gitops`] repo.
+
image::3-20.png[title="Figure 3-20: Argo CD applications for the POI backend."]
+
. The deployed application, comprising the NestJS service and its PostgreSQL database. The build pipeline and the webhook that triggers rebuilds and redeployments when source code changes are committed also run on the deployment target cluster, seen in the link:{console_url}/topology/ns/{namespace}?view=graph[OpenShift web console] in Figure 3-21.
+
image::3-21.png[title="Figure 3-21: OpenShift topology view of the POI backend."]

=== POI backend in the Software Catalog

The template scaffolding process added an entry to the Software Catalog for the POI backend, `{namespace}-poi-backend`. Switch to the link:{rhdh_url}/catalog[Catalog View] in the RHDH left navigation to see it (Figure 3-22). 

image::3-22.png[title="Figure 3-22: POI backend entity in the Software Catalog."]

You can inspect a component by clicking on its name to link:{rhdh_url}/catalog/default/component/{namespace}-poi-backend[open the component overview] (Figure 3-23).

image::3-23.png[title="Figure 3-23: POI backend component Overview tab."]

NOTE: The available tabs in the Component view depend on the configuration of the RHDH instance.

In the next sections, you will briefly visit the different tabs from that component detail view to figure out what you can learn about this registered catalog component that represents the backend service of the POI map application.

The Component screens in RHDH represent everything known about this application, derived from component metadata, information from plugin integrations with infrastructure services, like Argo CD, Tekton, and the OpenShift (or Kubernetes) cluster where executables run.

==== Overview tab

The link:{rhdh_url}/catalog/default/component/{namespace}-poi-backend[*Overview* tab] displays a few tiles, including an *About* section with direct access to the source code repository (*View source*) and technical documentation (*View TechDocs*). In the upper-right corner of a Component Overview’s About tile you can:


. Edit the underlying `catalog-info.yaml` contents in the corresponding Git repository to make changes to this catalog component.

. Trigger the portal to reread the component’s `catalog-info.yaml` and update the component with the new configuration and metadata.

The available information displayed in the details view and its different tabs is directly and largely based on the component’s `catalog-info.yaml` file. To give a simple example, the links tile holds custom component links which are found in the links section of this component’s YAML definition:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]

apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1

  providesApis:

  dependsOn: 
    - resource:default/{namespace}-poi-backend-db
----

Towards the end of this component definition you can see information about the owner, relationships regarding the logical grouping of components into a system, but also whether or not there are provided or consumed APIs for this component (`providesApis`), and if dependencies to other components and/or infrastructure resources (e.g., databases, messaging queues, caches) exist (`dependsOn`).

==== Topology tab

The Topology plug-in link:{rhdh_url}/catalog/default/component/{namespace}-poi-backend/topology[provides a tab] in the Component view showing the component’s resources on a deployment target OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster (Figure 3-24). These include the usual application resources in Kubernetes API terms, such as Deployment, Job, Daemonset, Statefulset, CronJob, and Pod. When you click on the POI backend deployment, a side pane slides in from the right to show more details. You can even retrieve logs from the container running in the pod, directly in the portal’s Component view.

image::3-24.png[title="Figure 3-24: POI backend component Topology tab."]

==== Issues and Pull / Merge Requests tabs

As a developer, you need to be aware of project issues as well as incoming changes from other developers. You can see this activity in your portal’s Component views. Based on plug-ins, RHDH can integrate with various Git hosting services such as GitLab, GitHub, and others to retrieve and link:{rhdh_url}/catalog/default/component/{namespace}-poi-backend/issues[display issues] (Figure 3-25) and link:{rhdh_url}/catalog/default/component/{namespace}-poi-backend/pr[pull/merge requests] (Figure 3-26), respectively. Because the component is freshly scaffolded and just registered in the catalog, unsurprisingly, both these tabs are currently empty. You will revisit them during the development of the application specific code.

image::3-25.png[title="Figure 3-25: POI backend component Issues tab."]

image::3-26.png[title="Figure 3-26: POI backend component Pull/Merge Requests tab."]

==== CI tab

In this tab, you can link:{rhdh_url}/catalog/default/component/{namespace}-poi-backend/ci[explore the build pipelines] for the component in question. This view isn’t limited to just one type of continuous integration (CI), but if applicable, can conveniently display multiple CI-related activities for the same component. In your example, and as shown in Figure 3-27, there are two different pipelines, namely:

. A *Tekton pipeline* used to create the container image for the backend service.
. A *GitLab pipeline* that is used for building and publishing the technical documentation for the component.

image::3-27.png[title="Figure 3-27: POI backend component, CI tab."]

A click on any of the listed pipeline runs shows the separate pipeline steps/stages and their respective outcomes. It’s also possible to retrieve the logs for each step/stage individually by clicking on it.

==== CD tab

In this example, the CD related information is retrieved from Argo CD by means of another plug-in. What’s shown is a link:{rhdh_url}/catalog/default/component/{namespace}-poi-backend/cd[basic tabular history] of the Argo CD application managing the component’s deployment (Figure 3-28).

image::3-28.png[title="Figure 3-28: POI backend component CD tab."]

Each component’s Overview Tab (see Figure 3-23) also shows an Argo CD status tile that relates the sync and health status and the last synced timestamp.

image::3-29.png[title="Figure 3-29: The POI backend’s Argo CD tile in the Component Overview tab."]

==== Kubernetes tab

In this tab (Figure 3-30), you can link:{rhdh_url}/catalog/default/component/{namespace}-poi-backend/kubernetes[inspect the various pods] underpinning the catalog component that are running in the target Kubernetes cluster, including some workload-related details. This is very handy, in particular, when there are any issues or errors with some of these pods.

image::3-30.png[title="Figure 3-30: POI backend component Kubernetes tab."]

==== API tab

Whether or not components either consume APIs from other components and/or provide APIs themselves, including API ownership information as well as system relationships if applicable, is all shown in the link:{rhdh_url}/catalog/default/component/{namespace}-poi-backend/api[API tab] (Figure 3-33). The scaffolded backend application provides an API that you can further investigate by clicking on its name. However, as this is currently a "Hello, World" REST endpoint, a more detailed discussion concerning API-related RHDH features follows at a later stage.

image::3-33.png[title="Figure 3-33: POI backend component API tab."]

==== Dependencies tab

Components very rarely live in isolation; instead, they are often logically grouped to form a superordinate system. In addition, components can directly depend on other components or resources such databases, caches, messaging infrastructure, and the like. Thankfully, the link:{rhdh_url}/catalog/default/component/{namespace}-poi-backend/dependencies[dependencies tab] provides insights into these aspects, with helpful diagrams illustrating more complex component hierarchies and/or relationships between components and resources (Figure 3-34).

image::3-34.png[title="Figure 3-34: POI backend component Dependencies tab."]

For the registered backend component you can see at a first glance:

. who owns it (`{user}`);
. which resource — in this case, database — it depends on (`{namespace}-poi-backend-db`);
. that it provides an API (`{namespace}-poi-backend-api`);
. and that this component is part of a system (`idp-system-{namespace}`).

As more components will be added by means of applying further templates and by properly maintaining all these relationships in the respective `catalog-info.yaml` files during the development phase, such diagrams will grow and thus become more valuable in making sense of larger and more complex systems.

==== Docs tab

Having technical documentation for registered catalog components is vital. The core idea is to live a “docs-like-code” approach. Under the covers, the default way to write documentation is based on Markdown and the documentation-related files are co-located in the same repository as the component’s source code. The link:{rhdh_url}/catalog/default/component/{namespace}-poi-backend/docs[Docs tab] (Figure 3-35) shows the latest available version of a component’s rendered HTML documentation, which has been generated and published as part of the configured CI pipeline. 

image::3-35.png[title="Figure 3-35: POI backend component Docs tab."]

== Proxy and frontend template

Now that the backend component’s link:{gitlab_url}/development/{namespace}-poi-backend/-/tree/main/[source code] and link:{gitlab_url}/development/{namespace}-poi-backend-gitops/-/tree/main/[GitOps repositories] are in place, you continue by applying the second custom template—the link:{rhdh_url}/create/templates/default/quarkus-with-angular[`quarkus-with-angular` template], which addresses the proxy and frontend parts of the POI map application. Go to link:{rhdh_url}/create[*+ Create*] and select the template *Quarkus Service with hosted Angular Frontend* by clicking the *[CHOOSE]* button in the lower-right corner of the corresponding template tile (Figure 3-36).

image::3-36.png[title="Figure 3-36: Portal Create view with template tiles."]

=== Template form wizard

This brings you into the template’s form wizard where you can parameterize certain elements of the template in question. You’ve been here before when scaffolding the backend component from the first template. What you are going to do here is strikingly similar.
In the first section of this form (Figure 3-37), you define information about the GitLab location used for publishing the resulting source code and GitOps repositories—leave the defaults as-is.

image::3-37.png[title="Figure 3-37: Quarkus Service with Angular template configuration form, first section."]

In the second section (Figure 3-38), you specify important settings, namely the *namespace* (`{namespace}`), *application ID* (default: `poi-map`), and *owner* (`user:{user}`) for our new software component. Based on this information it’s clear into which Kubernetes cluster and namespace this component is eventually going to be deployed with the entered application ID as its name. The selected user defines the ownership for this software component. 

NOTE: It’s important to make sure that you *use the same namespace (`{namespace}`) as the backend template* you applied earlier (see link:#_template_form_wizard_2[Template form wizard]).

image::3-38.png[title="Figure 3-38: Quarkus Service with Angular template configuration form, second section."]

In the third step (Figure 3-39), it’s defined which image registry to use for pushing the container image to. You can also choose a custom tag that will be used during the CI process to tag the container image with—leave the defaults as-is.

image::3-39.png[title="Figure 3-39: Quarkus Service with Angular template configuration form, third section."]

Clicking *NEXT STEP* shows a summary of all the entered form fields for a final review (Figure 3-40).

image::3-40.png[title="Figure 3-40: Quarkus Service with Angular template configuration form, final review."]

Finally, hit *CREATE* to kick off the actual templating process (Figure 3-41).

image::3-41.png[title="Figure 3-41: Quarkus Service with Angular template scaffolding results."]

=== Template scaffolding process

Insights into what’s happening during the scaffolding process under the covers have been provided in detail for the backend template already. Feel free to revisit the corresponding book section (link:#_template_scaffolding_process[Template scaffolding process]) if necessary.

=== Template results

As a result of applying this template, you end up with the following resources created on your behalf:

. In GitLab you have two new repositories, namely link:{gitlab_url}/development/{namespace}-poi-map[`{namespace}-poi-map`] and link:{gitlab_url}/development/{namespace}-poi-map-gitops[`{namespace}-poi-map-gitops`] (Figure 3-42).
+
image::3-42.png[title="Figure 3-42: GitLab repositories for the POI frontend."]
+
. In Argo CD, there are 3 new “applications” (bootstrap, build pipeline, actual application) for GitOps, as shown in Figure 3-43.
+ 
image::3-43.png[title="Figure 3-43: Argo CD applications for the POI frontend."]
+
. In Kubernetes, there is the deployed Quarkus proxy application, which also serves the Angular single page application frontend. Additionally, the build pipeline and the webhook related resources have been set up as seen in the link:{console_url}/topology/ns/{namespace}?view=graph[OpenShift web console] in Figure 3-44.

image::3-44.png[title="Figure 3-44: OpenShift topology view with the POI backend and frontend."]

=== POI proxy service and frontend in the Software Catalog

In contrast to the backend template, the major difference with this template is the fact that you end up with two separately registered catalog components. This is intentional, and results from the “monorepo” approach that has been chosen when creating the template for this proxy service that embeds the frontend application.

Switch to the link:{rhdh_url}/catalog[Catalog View] in Developer Hub to find and explore your two new software catalog components, which are link:{rhdh_url}/catalog/default/component/{namespace}-poi-map-frontend[`{namespace}-poi-map-frontend`] (Angular Single Page Application) and link:{rhdh_url}/catalog/default/component/{namespace}-poi-map-service[`{namespace}-poi-map-service`] (Quarkus proxy), as shown in Figure 3-45.

image::3-45.png[title="Figure 3-45: POI proxy service and frontend entities in the Software Catalog."]

You can inspect various details and important information about both these components by clicking on their respective names in the tabular listing to open a specific component’s detail view. 

NOTE: Keep in mind that the actual possibilities, the available tabs, and the tiles anywhere in that detail view primarily depend on the configuration of the RHDH instance, the installed plug-ins as well as any component view customizations which might or might not be in place for your environment.

In the next chapter, you’ll add code to the scaffolding provided by the templates to create a functional POI map.
